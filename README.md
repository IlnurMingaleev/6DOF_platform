# Stewart Platform
 The 6 6 Stewart Platform simulation is a 3D model of a robotic mechanism consisting of six struts and six connecting universal joints. It is used for motion control and precise positioning in various industries. The simulation allows for testing and optimizing the platform's performance in a virtual environment before implementation in the real world.
